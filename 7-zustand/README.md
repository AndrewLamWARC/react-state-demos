Todo app with "global" state zustand.

Zustand is my favorite state management library by Daishi Kato.
It's simple to understand yet powerful and typescript friendly.
It took me less than 1/2 hour to convert the redux based todo to zustand.

Devs have different interpretation of simple.
So I say stores written with zustand results in code that is smaller, tighter and easier to reason about.

This is the first state management library that is **not** provider based.
Provider based state libraries tend to result in the pyramid of doom jsx code.

Imagine a system that need stores for Auth, Profile, Theme, and the rest of the domain's system.
Each store requires it's own provider and will result in an additional level of nesting.
I must mention that redux is provider based but has 1 provider for it's 1 central store which can be divided into "slices" with redux toolkit.

Introduction to js state libraries

## Ambitions

- The need for state

- Local state, global state and remote/backend state

- Lift state up the component hierarchy

- Pass state down as props

- Pass action down as props

- Child components hook up actions from parent

- Async actions, state libraries like redux normally cannot handle async actions alone. react-thunk needed to handle async

- State libraries can be classified between provider based and non-provider based. Provider based libraries frequently result in pyramid of a doom provider component tree

1. Prop drilling without libraries

4. modern mobx with context api and hook
